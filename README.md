This illustraction is to learn the working and to visualize depth first search.
## Depth First Search(DFS)
The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any iteration.
### Idea
the user enters the source and the destination and the program returns a DFS traversed path from the source to the destination.
(the red path denoted the path travelled andmthe Triangular node depicts the destination city).
